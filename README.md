# Mars Rover RDT
this is my go at the mars rover challenge set by the RDT work experience
i did all of the prototypes in OOP in python without any extra libaries just messing around with python, sources will be linked in this repo.

### how i broke this task into smaller parts:
- there is a platoe on mars with more then multiple mars rovers on mars
- the rovers can face North, South, East, West and they can move forward depending on the direction they are facing
    - this is determined through commands like N,S,E,W
    - M is the command to move forward
- The program checks if the rover falls of the platoe

## How i built it
firstly i started with breaking the wordy problem down into something i could understand in my head, so i used a notebook and pretty much abstracted it down to the bare bones and made a Minimum viable product criteria that i could follow.
Then i started with building a single rover. This was the stage were i was trying to figure out different approaches to solving the problem. this can be seen through the prototypes in the
